# Installing Spring Boot

To install Spring boot simply follow the [installation guide in Spring website](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html)

To follow this book, you will require Java 1.8 and the [Spring Boot CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-installing-the-cli)

Spring Boot projects work well with both InteliJ and Eclipse, and this book try to avoid IDEs as much as possible.
